These images are honestly kinda crappy. I'm shelving this idea until I come across or think up a better way to generate images.

Ideas include:
* Figure out rules for placing polygons
* Generate images procedurally due to some clever formula
* Paint according to a scalar field generated as the solution of some parameterized system of differential equations?

Other things to do:
* Create an asycnhronous "watcher" to invoke functions.setNewBatch()
* Write an appropriate ImageGenerator._breed function.
* Fix up the index template (dynamically place things with jQuery, etc)
